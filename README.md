# pointnet with dynamic sampling, pyramid multiscale architecture and difficulty aware abilities
created by benz, xyz based on fork of Pointnet++

### Urgent codeing issues to be fixed
- [ ] The data preparation time cost is too high. 20 ms each block on NCI. Learning is also to slow, 100 ms.

### Model optimization plans
- [ ] Modify pointnet to dense net architecture
- [ ] Multi-architecture based on pyramid pooling
- [ ] Be difficulty-aware
- [ ] Compare pyramid and stacked feature encodering

### Sampling optimization plans
- [ ] Dynamic pooling based on previous prediction


### Performace items to be improved
- [ ] Each box use fix number points
- [ ] 3D learning on large scale scene: large block size


# The main workflow of our 3D instance segmentation network
* split scene to block [2,2,-1] m
* sample block to 8192 points. 
  Output: [b,8192,6] (6=x,y,z,r,g,b)
* (PFE) point feature encoder: learn the feature of each point with { [1x1 conv]x2 -> block maxpooling -> concatenate to each point } x 5.
  Output: [b,8192,512]   --output: mf = multiscale feature in block
* group to voxel [0.2,0.2,0.2]m, num point = 8
  Output: [b,1000,8,512]
* (VFE) feed each voxel to voxel feature encoder: { [8x1 conv] }
  Out: [b,1000,512]   --output: vf = voxel feature 
* (3DRPN)get object regions from voxels by 3D RPN
* Do semantic segmentation within each region
* Back inference voxel label to each point within a voxel

## PFE
1. Stacked PFE architecture
   just as PointNet++
2. Pyramid PFE architecture
   Assume the first point feature encoder is deep enough. Use pyramid pooling to get multi-scale features.
   Unlike PointNet++ where block feature is only concatenated once, it can be conatenated iteratively like VoxelNet.

# 3D object detection network
## Workflow
- Sampling whole point cloud into 45K points, output data: [batch, 45k, 4] (4=x,y,z,reflective) 
- (PFE) point feature encoder: using pointnet_sa_module x4 to do sampling and grouping operation (like convolutioanal neural network) to obtain downsmapled point cloud feature map, [batch, 1000, 512]
- (3DRPN) do classification and 3D bounding box regression to every point. We can use the 3 anchors bounding box (orientation angle: 0, pi/4, pi/2), so classifiction result is [batch, 1000, 2x3], the regression results is [batch, 1000, 3x7] (7= x, y, z, l, h, w, \theta)
  - every point is a proposl, every point has two branches, one for classification, one for bounding box regression
  - loss function consists of two part (classification and regression), the prediction bounding boxes whose IoU with ground truth is over a certain thresh is regarded as positive samples to train regression network, negative samples are ignore in regression training.

## To-do-list
- design the model architecture
  -- set five layers of pointnet_sa_module
  -- cancel pointnet_fp_module
 Â -- adding one FC-layer to every of 1000 points to do classification and regression
- write the loss function
  -- classification
  -- regression
- try to learn model with KITTI dataset
 

# Literature Review problems and ideas
* What is the approach of region mask fusion in MaskRCNN.
* Fusion of voxelnet and PointNet:
  VoxelNet advantage: voxel feature encoder learns the voxel feature iteratively and many times. But PointNet only lears once.
           disadvantage: voxel size is very small, one point can never learn larger scale shape information. But the PointNet block size is much larger.
  -> Generate voxel within a block after feature encoder of PointNet, instead of from the whole scene.
  -> Then feed the voxel to RPN.
* I believe Deformable convolution may be significantly useful for 3D learning.
  Actually, it is a dynamicaly sampling for convulutional locationsbased on learnt features. Theoretically, the learnt offset should be instance region proposal.
  - Let deformabel convolution automatically sample dense in difficult area and sparse in easy area.
  - Or just use deformabel convolution to make region proposal of difficult area. Beacuse the shape of difficult area can definitely be replaced by a box. This technique may be useful.
 
* One feasible idea is to combine the VoxNet and Frustum idea, use the VoxNet method to generate the region proposals and use the Frustum idea to refine the 3D boxes.

* Making region proposals directly based semantic sementation points, then, downsampling the semantic points, predict a proposals on every downsampled point. The refine network is used to achieve more accurate classification and boxing estimation. Also try do sematic feature predict and instance predict togother.

* Frustum is one way to generate 3D proposals from image detection results, there are some other ways, like enumerating all fixed 3D bounding boxes and projecting it into image, selecting the one with the hight IOU, then do refinement, which can avoid overlaps between different group points.

### PointNet++: *Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space*

Guibas</a> from Stanford University.

This is work is based on our paper linked <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02413.pdf">here</a>. The code release is still in an ongoing process... Stay tuned!

Current release includes TF operators (CPU and GPU), some core pointnet++ layers and a few example network models.

The TF operators are included under `tf_ops`, you need to compile them (check `tf_xxx_compile.sh` under each ops subfolder) first. Update `nvcc` and `python` path if necessary. The code is tested under TF1.2.0. If you are using earlier version it's possible that you need to remove the `-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` flag in g++ command in order to compile correctly.

TF and pointnet++ utility layers are defined under `utils/tf_util.py` and `utils/pointnet_util.py`

Under `models`, two classification models (SSG and MSG) and SSG models for part and semantic segmentation have been included.
